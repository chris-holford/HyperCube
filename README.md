>This was a protoype for a larger vision I proposed for my friend who was managing an independent music artist. We planned to build a 6-8 foot version that they would perform inside of for a music video. However, if you know anything about the material costs of 216-384 square feet of half-silvered acrylic and the relative budgets of independent artists, you know that this idea was scrapped in favor of a few Titan tubes and a guy with a Steadicam in their own living room.

>A lot of the problem solving for this project was in mapping the layout of the strips into an array in such a way that functions could be applied in a meaningful way. 

>Going forward, I am working on implementing some interesting animations triggered by MIDI. Also, the 3-corner wiring was meant to facilitate the lengths of strips we would have needed, so I also plan to rework it into a single data wire with jumpers between edges.
